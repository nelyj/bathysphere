Bathysphere
===========

Fetch arbitrarily deep properties from YAML files without loosing your breath.

Bathysphere takes benefit of a self-describing YAML-based data format to
normalize options fetching, so the same option can be stored at different
depths in distinct configuration files.

Installation
------------

Add the gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
# Gemfile

gem 'bathysphere', '0.1.0' # see semver.org
```
