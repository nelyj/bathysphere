Bathysphere
===========

Fetch arbitrarily deep properties from YAML files without loosing your breath.

Bathysphere takes benefit of a self-describing YAML-based data format to
normalize options fetching, so the same option can be stored at different
depths in distinct configuration files.

> **DISCLAIMER**: This is an early version of Bathysphere, please be aware that it will not be stable until `v1.0.0`. Until then you can consult the [intended API][intent] and, at any moment, [feedback][issues] is welcome! : ) -- [GB][gonzalo-bulnes]
